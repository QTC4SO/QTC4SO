## Corpus
If you want to download our datasets.[Please click here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M0gh2h6u4c7K4QmVae5cbhU4XL-W24ZY?usp=share_link)<br>


## Model
Our pre-trained model has been released on hugging face.[Please click here.](https://huggingface.co/QTC4SO/QTC4SO)


## RQ1
<font color=blue>Motivation:</font>To demonstrate the effectiveness of QTC4So,we choose five automatic measures to evaluate the qualityof question titles generated by QTC4SO and our consideredbaselines in this RQ.

## RQ2
<font color=blue>Motivation:</font>In this RQ, we want to conduct ablation experiments by investigating the performance impact of differentinput modals (i.e.ï¼Œthe problem description and the codesnippet) on QTC4SO.

## RQ3
<font color=blue>Motivation:</font>In this RQ, we want to investigate the performance impact of different pre-trained models on QTC4So.Therefore,we consider the other three popular pre-trained models from the field of natural language processing.

## RQ4
<font color=blue>Motivation:</font> To effectively evaluate the semantic information in the generated question titles and avoid the weakness of the automatic evaluation measures (e.g., some measures aredesigned by only considering the lexical overlap between the ground-truth titles and the generated titles), we want to conducta human study to evaluate the effectiveness of QTC4SO in this RQ.

Here is our Criteria.

This figure shows the evaluation results.

## Discussion
In this section,we try to analyze the advantage of multitask learning in QTC4SO.The result shows that multitask learning can improve the performance of QTC4SO.

## Our demo
we provide a [demo](./model_code/demo.py).<br>
You can make the model complete a title for you by modifying the `prefix`,`incomplete title`,`problem description` and `code snippet `.
